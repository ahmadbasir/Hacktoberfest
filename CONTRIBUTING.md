## Contributing

Nanobox manages a collection of open-source projects to which you're welcome to contribute. Any contributions to Nanobox projects should follow the following process and guidelines.

### Contribution Process

##### **Fork**, *then* clone the project:

`git clone git@github.com:your-username/project-name.git`

##### Create your feature branch:

Your branch name should reflect the changes contained within (`update/my-update`, `bugfix/my-bugfix`, etc.).

`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`

##### Commit your changes:

If you have multiple commits, [squash](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-android/wiki/Squash-All-Commits-Related-to-a-Single-Issue-into-a-Single-Commit) merge them into a single commit.

`git commit -am 'Added my feature'`

##### Push to the feature branch:

`git push origin feature/my-feature`

#### Create a new pull request

### Contribution Guidelines

Pull requests must do the following in order to be merged:

- Match the style of code already existing in the project.
- Must not contain any merge conflicts (Pull and merge master before submitting the pull request).
- For projects that already have tests in place, include tests for the modifications in your commit.
